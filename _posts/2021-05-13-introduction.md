Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) is one of the world's oldest and biggest cancer treatment centers. MSK has a wealth of free-text reports and a diverse patient population. In 2018, we began to explore the idea of using these reports to detect progression of diseases, which can potentially revolutionize both patient care and clinical research. We chose radiology texts because these reports have a semi-structured format that we could take advantage of, while taking advantage of the fact that a patient suspicious of having a progressing disease would typically be given a radiology exam. This initial exploration bared fruit and set up a large-scale collaboration between us and the Radiology department here in MSK.

In 2019, we were able to use machine learning to detect certain phenomenon in texts, such as splenomegaly with accuracy higher than 90%.

In 2020, we transitioned from traditional machine learning methods to state-of-the-art approaches via deep learning. We deduced that given the amount of data MSK accumulated over many years of patient care, deep learning should come into the picture so to provide the best scalability. We also scaled up our computation resourced, transitioning to a GPU server and began to experiment with AWSâ€™s cloud solutions so as to accommodate for this new capability.

We then officially formed a team that has since grown to having four full-time members, as we are ready to tackle the toughest problem in cancer care with NLP.
